## Reflection

This course taught me how to use C++ to approach problems logically. I learned the value of building algorithms, controlling the flow of a program with conditions and loops, and organizing code effectively using functions. The process of writing and debugging programs trained me to be more patient and detail-oriented.

I personally think that adding small projects would help students enhance teamwork and programming practice. I felt proud and satisfied whenever a program I wrote ran as intended. By the end of the course, I was able to write programs to handle data, perform operations and solve practical problems. This subject also strengthened my logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, which are essential for my future journey in software development.
