## Introduction
This assignment requires the development of a C++ program to create a Proton Car Loan Calculator that estimates the monthly installment for a car loan. The program allows users to input details such as car model, variant, region, down payment, interest rate, and repayment period. Based on these inputs, the program calculates and displays the monthly installment clearly and accurately.

## Summary
The program was successfully developed using C++. The program accepts user input, displays selected car information, and calculates the monthly installment based on the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment period. Branching was used to determine car models, variants, and regions, while looping allowed users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.User-defined functions were implemented to separate tasks such as calculating the monthly installment, which improved the readability and organization of the code. Overall, the program met all the requirements and produced outputs similar to the given example.

## Reflection
From this assignment, I gained practical experience in applying C++ programming concepts to solve a real-world problem. One of the challenges was ensuring that user inputs were correctly processed and that calculations followed the correct formula. However, by breaking the program into smaller parts using functions, the problem became easier to manage.
