## Introduction
This project was developed as part of a programming task to help the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia analyze student statistics for public universities in 2015. The main goal of the program is to process real-world data related to student intake, enrolment, and output using C++. By reading data from an input file and producing a well-formatted output file, this project demonstrates how file handling, arrays, and functions can be used together to solve practical problems.

## Summary
In this task, a complete C++ program was created to read student data from an external file (input.txt) that contains the list of public universities in Malaysia along with their student intake, enrolment, and output numbers. The program stores this data in arrays and performs several calculations, including:
- Total number of students for intake, enrolment, and output
- Average number of students for each category
- Highest and lowest values along with the corresponding university
- Range (difference between highest and lowest values) for each category

The program uses multiple functions such as getInput, calTotal, getLowest, and getHighest to keep the code organized and readable. Proper input validation ensures that the program only runs when the input file is successfully opened. All results are written neatly into an output file (output.txt) using proper formatting.

## Reflection
This project helped me better understand how C++ can be used to handle real data scenarios rather than just simple console inputs. I learned how important it is to structure a program using functions, as it makes the code easier to manage and debug. Working with file input and output also improved my understanding of how programs interact with external data sources.
Additionally, implementing features like finding the highest, lowest, and range values strengthened my logic and problem-solving skills. Overall, this task gave me more confidence in writing complete, functional programs and showed me how programming concepts apply to real-world applications, especially in data analysis and reporting.
