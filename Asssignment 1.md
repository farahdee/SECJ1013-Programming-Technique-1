## Introduction
This assignment focuses on analyzing a given problem and designing a solution using a flowchart. The task required the development of a Loan Calculator that can estimate monthly loan installments to help users plan their finances effectively. In this assignment, important programming concepts such as branch, loop, and user-defined functions were applied. The flowchart includes a main function to ensure the solution is well-structured, logical, and easy to understand. This activity helps improve problem-solving skills and understanding of program logic before actual coding.

## Summary
This assignment successfully demonstrated how a loan calculator system can be designed using a flowchart. The flowchart shows the overall process of receiving user input, calculating loan installments, and displaying the results. Branching was used to validate inputs or make decisions, looping allowed repeated calculations when required, and user-defined functions helped separate tasks into smaller, manageable parts. By completing this task, the problem was clearly analyzed and translated into a structured flowchart that follows proper programming logic. This assignment provided a better understanding of how real-world financial problems can be solved systematically using flowchart techniques.

## Reflection
Through this assignment, I gained a better understanding of how to design a logical and organized flowchart. At first, it was challenging to decide where to place loops, conditions, and functions correctly. However, after analyzing the problem step by step, it became easier to structure the flowchart.
I also learned the importance of user-defined functions, as they help make the flowchart more readable and modular.
